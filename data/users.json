Pawn - Moves one square forward(but not captures forward), but on its first move, it can move two squares forward. It captures diagonally one square forward. Please note that the king cannot be captured! When a king is attacked, it is called \"check.\" Requirements for En pessant: The capturing pawn must have advanced exactly three ranks to perform this move. The captured pawn must have moved two squares in one move, landing right next to the capturing pawn. The en passant capture must be performed on the turn immediately after the pawn being captured moves. If the player does not capture en passant on that turn, they no longer can do it later. Pawn promotion occurs when a pawn reaches the farthest rank from its original square—the eighth rank for White and first rank for Black. When this happens, the player can replace the pawn for a queen. Castling involves the king and a rook. There are many rules to castling: The first is that you may only castle if you haven't moved your king and your rook (on the side where you want to castle). The second rule is that no piece can be between your king and the rook on the side where you want to castle. If you are currently in check, you cannot castle.
